# Tic-Tac-Toe Game: Winner Determination

This is a simple Python program that determines the winner of a Tic-Tac-Toe game based on the input provided for the game board. The program checks the rows, columns, and diagonals to see if any player has won.

## Features
- Checks for the winner across all rows, columns, and diagonals.
- Prints "Abhinav Wins" if Abhinav wins (O's).
- Prints "Anjali Wins" if Anjali wins (X's).
- Prints "Tie" if neither player wins after all conditions are checked.

## How to Use

1. Run the Python script.
2. Input the Tic-Tac-Toe board, row by row, with space-separated values for each row.
   - Example:
     ```
     O X O
     O X O
     O X X
     ```

3. The script will output the winner based on the game logic.
